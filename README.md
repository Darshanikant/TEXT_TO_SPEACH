# TEXT_TO_SPEACH
 ## ext-to-Speech Generation
- This project implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation model that converts textual input into natural-sounding speech. 
- The model leverages deep learning techniques to generate realistic audio outputs based on the given text.
-It supports multiple languages and can be adapted for various use cases like virtual assistants, audiobook generation, and accessibility tools.

# Features:
- Converts text into speech using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Supports multiple languages (depending on the model used).
- Provides customizable speech output with parameters like speed, pitch, and volume.
- Easy-to-use interface with integration options for various applications.
 # Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (Depending on the model used)
- Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt
# Future Improvements:
- Adding more voice variations.
- Improving multi-language support.
- Enhancing the real-time speech generation speed.
